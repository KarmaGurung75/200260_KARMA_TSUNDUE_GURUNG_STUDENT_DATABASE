Intruoduction
  Student Management System manages student information, academic reports, college information, 
  course information, curriculum, batch information, and other resource-related information.
  It keeps track of a student's information from day one to the end of his course, 
  which can be used for various reporting purposes such as attendance tracking,
  course progress,completed semester years, upcoming semester year curriculum details,
  exam details,project or other assignment details, final exam result, and so on. 
  But in this we will just go throught simple project of student database management.
  
Objetive of the project
  The project's goals are divided into three categories and defined in advance.
  Knowing the beginning capacity of one's own by constructing this type of project falls under the personal category.
  It also has to do with determining what kind of equipment I'll need to complete the project.
  According to academic category, developing a project will assist me in determining which educational subject I am most interested in
  while also providing myself with long-term information.On a technical level, this project allows me to learn more about the technologies and gain new skills


Features and Functions
  It have the login or register function,where you can login directly with valid email and password.
  if you dont have email and password then you can also eaily register by filling all the valid data.
  As the login and register function it also do same with the adding new data or display exsiting data.

Scope Of the project
  The scope of this project is about the implementation of an automated student record management system that allows university users, such as students and professors,
  to easily access to the information via a user-friendly desktop application. At its most basic level, 
  this suggested system intends to eliminate the time-consuming and perhaps dangerous habit of manually maintaining student information on paper.
  There are numerous departments at a university, each of which keeps track of various student records. 
  
 
Conclusion
  Educational institutions can utilize a Student Management System to easily keep track of their students' records. 
  Using the manual system, achieving this goal is challenging since information is fragmented, redundant, and collecting relevant data might take a long time.
  This project solves all of these issues. This system aids in the management of the organization's student information. 
  It is easily accessible by the manager and can be kept safe for a long time with no alterations.
